              Tokyo Disneyland (東京ディズニーランド, Tōkyō Dizunīrando) (local
              nickname TDL) is a 115-acre theme park at the Tokyo Disney Resort
              in Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture, Japan, near Tokyo. Its main gate is
              directly adjacent to both Maihama Station and Tokyo Disneyland
              Station. It was the first Disney park to be built outside the
              United States and it opened on April 15, 1983. The park was
              constructed by WED Enterprises in the same style as Disneyland in
              California and Magic Kingdom in Florida. It is owned by The
              Oriental Land Company, which licenses intellectual property from
              The Walt Disney Company. Tokyo Disneyland and its companion park,
              Tokyo DisneySea, are the only Disney parks in the world not owned
              or operated by The Walt Disney Company in any capacity.

              Universal Orlando Resort, often shortened to Universal Orlando, is
              a 541-acre theme park and entertainment resort complex located in
              Orlando, Florida. Following the opening of Universal Studios
              Florida in 1990, MCA moved forward with plans to expand from a
              single park into a large resort hoping to compete with Walt Disney
              World. In 1999, a second theme park called Universal Islands of
              Adventure opened in addition to Universal CityWalk, a shopping
              promenade and nightlife district that incorporates a variety of
              themed hotels, restaurants, and retail outlets. A third park,
              30-acre water park Universal Volcano Bay, was added in 2017, and a
              fourth theme park, Universal Epic Universe, is scheduled to open
              in 2025.
